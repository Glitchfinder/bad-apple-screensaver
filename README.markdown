“Bad Apple!!” Screensaver
=========================

This is my reimplementation of [Bad Apple!! Screensaver](http://cir9.seesaa.net/). It aimed to be a lightweight alternative to the original one.



Download
--------

Please visit [“Bad Apple!!” Screensaver 2.x](http://blog.bcse.tw/bad-apple-screensaver-2) to download the latest build.



Software Requirements & Installation
------------------------------------

1. Please install [.NET Framework 3.5](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=333325fd-ae52-4e35-b531-508d977d32a6) and [DirectX 9.0](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=2da43d38-db71-4c1b-bc6a-9b6652cd92a3) first.
2. Extract the file, right-click on BadApple.scr and click Install.
3. The software does not include Bad Apple!! video in it. Please prepare the file in advance and configure the video path before using the screensaver.



Configuration
-------------

1. Please set the video path before first use.
2. If you don't know how to set Saturation, I suggest setting Saturation to 0% (left) when you selected a black-and-white video. If you selected a color video, please try setting Saturation to 100% (right).
